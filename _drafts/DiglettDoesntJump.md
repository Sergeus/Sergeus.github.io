There's a mini-game you play when transferring Pokémon over from Generation 4 (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart Gold, & Soul Silver) to Generation 5 (Black, White, Black 2, & White 2). You transfer the Pokémon in batches of 6, and each time you have to catch them using a little slingshot-with-a-Pokéball as the Pokémon jump between bushes.

But Game Freak are here for the little details. And they continue to impress in this little transfer mini-game.

Why?

*Here's why*

Because the Pokémon jump between the bushes. But not all Pokémon can jump, because it wouldn't make sense. So as the title of this blog post and my sneak peek a few weeks ago said: Diglett doesn't jump. It (and Dugtrio) have special behavior where they move across the ground in between the bushes instead of jumping:
