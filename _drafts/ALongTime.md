Short one this time. I've been playing Pokémon a long time. I know that. You know that.

My Pokémon Ranch for the Wii came out during Generation 4 (Diamond & Pearl), which I consider to be roughly "half way" through the series.

I started up My Pokémon Ranch the other day, to check if I had left any Pokémon in there (I had).
