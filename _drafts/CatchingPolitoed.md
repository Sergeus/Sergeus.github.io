[Politoed](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/186.shtml), introduced in Generation 2 (Gold & Silver), a green frog Pokémon that evolves from [Poliwhirl](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/061.shtml). Poliwhirl is one of those Pokémon that evolves from trading. Game Freak use this mechanic to encourage players to play together and make friends. So if you trade a Poliwhirl from one game to another it will evolve into Politoed if it's holding a [King's Rock](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/kingsrock.shtml).

*You too can trade [Magikarp](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/129.shtml) for Magikarp for no reason*

Trade evolutions have been around since the beginning, back in Generation 1 (Red & Blue) [Haunter](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/093.shtml), [Graveler](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/075.shtml), [Kadabra](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/064.shtml), and [Machoke](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/067.shtml) were first to showcase traded evolutions. In Generation 2, Game Freak introduced traded evolutions that depend on held items (and introduced the mechanic of Pokémon holding items). This gave new evolutions to existing Pokémon like Poliwhirl, [Onix](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/095.shtml), [Scyther](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/123.shtml), [Seadra](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/117.shtml), and [Slowpoke](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sm/079.shtml) (some of whom already evolved into other Pokémon in Generation 1). 

But what if you want a Politoed and none of your friends are really into Pokémon? There's always the online [Global Trade System](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Global_Trade_System). You can't ask for a Pokémon holding a specific item, but you can just ask for a Politoed. Chances are, someone will trade you one eventually (for some Pokémon you're willing to offer up). But what if you don't have a connection to the internet handy? Or you want your Politoed to definitely be *your* Politoed.

*And who wouldn't want one of these handsome devils?*

Don't worry, Game Freak have you covered. In Generation 7 (Sun & Moon) Politoed can in fact be caught in the wild.

First, I have to explain [SOS battles](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/SOS_Battle). They're a new feature in Generation 7 where if a defending wild Pokémon is weakened or otherwise encouraged, it can call for help from other wild Pokémon. Sometimes another wild Pokémon will answer that call and join the battle against the player. And sometimes that other wild Pokémon is of a different species from the Pokémon that originally called for help.

If you want to catch that Politoed in Sun & Moon, then you'll need to head to [Malie Garden](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Malie_Garden) (a cultivated garden in one of [Alola](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alola)'s cities). When a Pokémon calls for help there (an SOS battle), there is a 1% chance that the Pokémon that answers the call will be a Politoed. If it's raining. At night.

1%. Raining. At night.

*I like to think someone at Game Freak had a good laugh about this*

Best part? It only rains for about an hour every night in Malie Garden. So you'd better be quick!
