title: Punctuation Unown

Unown, the alphabet Pokémon has been around since Generation 2 (Gold & Silver). Today I have a quick tidbit about *Heart* Gold & *Soul* Silver, the remakes from 2010.

There are 26 obvious Unown, one for each letter of the Roman alphabet.

There are also 2 punctuation Unown (? and !), who are *absolutely sick of this shit*.

*Look at how dissatisfied they are*

Getting the punctuation Unown is relatively involved. There are a bunch of guides (LINKS GO HERE) about how to do that online.

I did this recently and I ran into a tiny quibble that none of the guides mentioned. Setting aside that I caught 36 Shadow Pokémon and purified 41 of them in Pokémon Colosseum to get a Ho-oh for one of the puzzles - ANYWAY!

The guides all talk about the 4 puzzles and the 4 secret rooms. (I also had to find a Water Stone.)

I completed them all and went and talked to the guy in the Research Center. He unlocked page 7 of the Unown report for me. All the guides say "complete the 4 puzzles and the 4 hidden rooms" and some of them specifically mention "and then you'll get page 7 of the Unown report", and then they tell you to go to the entrance of the Ruins of Alph, where a cutscene will play and the punctuation Unown will unlock.

But it didn't work. I couldn't trigger the cutscene that would allow me to catch the punctuation Unown in the entrance tunnel.

I, who was reading from guides online and had not seen this completed before, didn't know that the researcher had only given me *the first half* of page 7 of the Unown report.

Because it turns out that you don't only have to complete the 4 puzzles and enter the 4 secret rooms. You *also* have to *drop down the hole at the back of every secret room*.

One of the rooms was quite close to the start of the Ruins of Alph, and after completing the room, I knew how to get to the other one. So rather than walk through the underground section of the ruins and fend off a bunch of Unown along the way, I backed out and walked to the next secret room after only picking up the items.

Thankfully I worked this out by dropping through each of them in sequence. (The text on the Unown report actually was quite helpful here.)

So there you have it! In addition to completing the 4 puzzles and entering the 4 secret rooms, you must also *drop from each of the secret rooms into the Ruins* in order to unlock the final part of page 7 of the Unown Report, which allows you to trigger the cutscene that causes the punctuation Unown to appear at the Ruins entrance.

Now you, and the internet, know that. Because I panicked back before it did.
