One, tiny factoid for you today. When trading for Jasmine's Steelix (named Rusty) in Heart Gold & Soul Silver, you have to talk to her *twice* after you've fulfilled all the conditions.

The gym leader rematch system is pretty great. And it's fairly elaborate - relying on real world time. (And all done after beating the game.) For Jasmine, you have to catch her at the Olivine Dining Room café between 1 and 2pm (real time) to get her PokéGear number.

Then you have to call her on Wednesday afternoon (10am to 7:59pm - yes afternoon starts before noon) to arrange a rematch. Once you do that you have to battle her at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. (Her team will be levels 50-62.)

And *finally*! Once you have won the match, you go and talk to her again, back at her gym in Olivine City. And she says:

*Wait, there is a trade*

And then stops.

I was, very briefly, very confused. I had done all the things I'd read online to trade for her Steelix! But she is characterized as being very shy. So just in case, I talked to her again. And *then* we could do the trade!

Phew!
