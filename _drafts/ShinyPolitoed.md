Two weeks ago, I wrote a post about [Catching Politoed]({% post_url 2017-11-25-CatchingPolitoed %}) and how, while it can be found in the wild, it's extremely rare and has some exotic environment requirements before it's even possible to encounter it. You may want to read that post first before this week's, since I'm going to assume you already know the things I outlined in that post while I'm talking below.

This week, we're going to talk about Shiny Politoed. Someone [asked me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pyroka/status/934410053850935296) in response to my previous post what the chances are of finding a Shiny Politoed in the wild. That turns out to be quite an interesting question, so here we are with a post about it. Fair warning for non-technical readers, this post (more so than any other on this blog so far) contains a lot of math.

Let's start at the beginning. What are [shiny Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shiny_Pok%C3%A9mon)? They've been around since Generation 2 (Gold & Silver), which were the first games to really have color. (Red, Blue, & Yellow would display everything in shades of the color of their version if played on the Gameboy Color, but the game was effectively still grayscale, just colorized // CONFIRM TRUE.) Shiny Pokémon are variants of their normal species that are differently colored from most others. Shininess doesn't affect the gameplay capabilities of the Pokémon, it's a purely aesthetic difference.

The chances of running into a shiny Pokémon in the wild, in any given random encounter, are 1/4096 (about 0.024%). Starting in Black 2 & White 2 (in Generation 5), if you complete the Pokédex (catch all Pokémon in that game) and show it to a specific Game Freak employee character (there are characters based on actual Game Freak developers squirreled away in each game), then they'll give you the [Shiny Charm](https://www.serebii.net/itemdex/shinycharm.shtml). The Shiny Charm increases the chance of you encountering a shiny Pokémon in Generation 7 (Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, & Ultra Moon) by 300% to about 1/1365.3 (so a whopping 0.073%).

But that's not all. SOS battles, the mechanism through which you can find Politoed in the wild in Generation 7, also affect the shiny encounter rate.

Politoed, like every other Pokémon, can also be shiny.
