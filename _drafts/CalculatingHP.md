How much HP should this Pokémon have? That depends on a lot of factors. At some level, like all other stats, the Pokémon will have a Base HP. Different species (Bulbasaur vs Arceus vs Umbreon, and all other 799 of them) have differing Base HPs. Pokémon gain HP as they level up, so a level 76 Chansey will have a lot more HP than a level 5 one.

Each individual Pokémon you catch will have different HP IVs - the initial seed of how much better or worse its HP will be than other Pokémon of the same species. (Not all Rattata are made the same.) And each Pokémon you train will accrue some EVs - and HP EVs will increase their HP. There are also temporary ways of increasing a Pokémon's HP during battle, such as, HP EXAMPLE HERE.



Or your Pokémon could be a Shedinja, in which case it has a HP of 1. Exactly. One. Pokémon. And it has a fixed HP stat, while *everybody* else listens to the equation.
